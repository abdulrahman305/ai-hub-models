Please summarize the following article about artificial intelligence and machine
learning:

Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized numerous industries over the
past decade, transforming how businesses operate and how people interact with
technology. Machine learning, a subset of AI, has enabled computers to learn
and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. This
technology has found applications in healthcare, where it assists in medical
diagnosis and drug discovery, in finance for fraud detection and algorithmic
trading, and in transportation through autonomous vehicles.

The development of deep learning, which mimics the human brain's neural
networks, has been particularly groundbreaking. These systems can process vast
amounts of data to identify patterns and make predictions with remarkable
accuracy. However, the rapid advancement of AI also raises important questions
about ethics, job displacement, and the need for responsible development
practices. As AI continues to evolve, researchers are focusing on creating
more explainable and transparent systems that can be trusted by users and
regulators.
